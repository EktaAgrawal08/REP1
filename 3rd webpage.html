<h1>
DEAR PARENTS,</h1>
<h3>
As somebody once said, nothing can stop an idea whose time has come. Presidium, we believe, is one such idea.<br><br>

The school is founded on the belief that children should be encouraged to dream, and passionately pursue their dreams. <br><br>
We work towards opening their minds, help them identify their interests and aspirations, and nourish their individual talents.<br><br>

We believe that every one of our students has the potential to become a leader of tomorrow.<br><br>

Our unique philosophy has already produced significant results. Presidians today excel in competitions, talent searches and sports meets.<br>
<br> Their academic performance is as sterling too.<br><br>

Another proof that our worldview has found wide acceptance is our remarkable growth in a short span of time – at present 
Presidium has seven schools and centres of excellence like Starmakers, Currimakers and Lifemakers. 
<br><br>
These centres are being steered by teams
 of experts who see the child as a whole, as someone who not only has intellectual needs and potential but also
 needs nurturing of his/her social and emotional being.
<br><br><u><i>
Today Presidium is more than a school; it’s a movement that is transforming not just the sphere of education, but society at large</i>.</u><br><br>

<b>Our mission, however, has always remained the same. We are, and always will be, a school for the leaders of tomorrow.</b><br>
