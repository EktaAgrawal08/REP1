This is a coeducational school with a friendly ethos and small class sizes that allow us to cater for the unique talents, 
needs and ambitions of our children.
</i></p><br>

<p>
A well-rounded education-
Learning is about more than the formal classroom curriculum. Boys and girls at the School have wonderful opportunities to 
develop, not only through their teachers 
but also through their contributions.
</p><br>

<p><u><i>
Specialist teachers-</i></u>
Our primary school specialists understand how young people learn and are able to give pupils the necessary confidence and 
skills they need to face the new 
challenges and fresh opportunities that await them in the Senior School.
</p><br>

<p><u><i>
An educational jounney-</i></u>
Academy pupil have much in common, but their ability and their potential are far from uniform. We treat each one in exactly
 the same way – as an individual.
 Our aim to prepare children well for their Senior School years and beyond.
</p><br>
<br><u><i>
Building on strengths-</i></u>

From your son or daughter’s first day at the School, we aim to create an atmosphere in which they are keen to learn and eager to progress.
 Personal attention 
from committed teachers identifies the abilities of each pupil, and 
encourages them to make full use of those abilities. New technologies give the pupils new opportunities for discovery, while retaining a
 base in traditional learning.

Here we believe that each member of our ‘family’ will have an experience filled with great happiness in an atmosphere of ordered 
freedom; will be encouraged to explore and enquire in a variety of ways (from using the latest of
technologies to the wilderness of our Forest School); will gain a rigorous grounding in those key skills necessary for academic 
advanceCare, love and emotional security underpin our ethos.

Being responsible for the education of our youngsters is a privilege and I would be delighted to meet with you to discuss how your 
child could become an important part of this vibrant school preparing children for the demands of 21st century life.

At the School, we seek to nurture and develop your child’s potential, creativity and intelligence, expand their horizons and
 provide a foundation they can build on throughout their life. And at the School, we aim to fully prepare your child for the progression through their later school years.

<center><h2><u><i>OUR AIMS IN BRIEF</i></u></h2></center>
<BR><br>

<h3>
<p>
*We seek to develop the individual strengths of each child at our school,
 and we are committed to preserving a small school where each unique personality can be recognised and valued.
</p><br>

<p>
*We aim to foster in pupils of every ability a real sense of purpose, so that their individual gifts may be put to good use in the long years after school. Good teachers inspire a child with a love of 
learning that endures long after specific facts are forgotten.
</p><br>

<p>
*We wish to develop young people whose worlds are not centered upon themselves alone. Our aim is not just to create another face in the crowd but to nurture each student in to developing a personality which has the resolve to do the nation proud. Love, tolerance, brotherhood, humanity, patriotism, sensitivity to the environment, nationalism, courage to bear the life's contingencies and to take up cudgels on behalf of the under privileged are the hallmarks of our students. Our school endeavors to provide a genuine and holistic education in a stress free environment where students are inculcated with a spirit of enquiry. We not only train them to find 
challenging careers but also to face the complexities of life.
